# Seoul_Bike_rental
### Can we help app based rental companies in Seoul, South Korea predict demand based on time and environmental factors.
ML Task To deal with seoul bike rental datset to get insights and prediction about bike prediction ..

Managing a fleet of vehicles is an important task for any ride share or rental company. The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model that could make an accurate prediction of how many bikes would be rented based on factors such as day of the week, time of day, temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, and solar radiation. The dataset had 8,760 observations, with each observation representing one hour of one day. The target variable is ‘Rented Bike Count’ and there were 13 attributes to work with. The baseline rental count for any given day is 735 bikes. We’ll be looking at various models’ R-squared scores to see if we can make better predictions.

## Languages and APIs used :
. Data visualisation : show correlations between the data and the target on the Jupyter Notebook using(Seaborn and matplotlib)
. Machine learning algorithm modelisation on the Jupyter Notebook (using different models)
